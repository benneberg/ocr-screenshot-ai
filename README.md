# üì∏ SnapOCR ‚Äî AI Screenshot Helper

**Author:** Lukas Benneberg  
**Date:** 2025-09-27  
**License:** [MIT](LICENSE)

A lightweight **mobile-first web app** to extract text from screenshots and use AI to classify, explain, and suggest next steps.  

Designed for technical teams working with digital signage devices (e.g., Samsung Tizen) but flexible enough for any workflow.

## Features

- **OCR (Optical Character Recognition)**  
  - Upload screenshots (error messages, provisioning keys, logs).  
  - Extract plain text with [Tesseract.js](https://github.com/naptha/tesseract.js).  

- **AI Integration (Groq API)**  
  - Explain text, classify its type (error, key, log, config, etc.).  
  - Suggest next steps or fixes.  
  - Powered by [Groq‚Äôs fast inference API](https://groq.com/).  

- **Settings Panel**  
  - Store API key in localStorage (no backend).  
  - Choose AI model.  
  - Adjust temperature and max tokens.  
  - Add a system prompt for custom behavior.  

- **Custom Actions (CTA Buttons)**  
  - Define your own AI prompts as buttons.  
  - Fully editable (inline editing, delete, reorder).  
  - Group actions by **Projects**.  

- **Workflows (Chained CTAs)**  
  - Chain multiple prompts together as a **workflow**.  
  - Each step feeds into the next.  
  - Example: *Summarize error ‚Üí Translate summary ‚Üí Suggest fix*.  

- **Mobile-first UX**  
  - Responsive layout.  
  - Collapsible settings panel.  
  - Copy-to-clipboard buttons for outputs.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (no frameworks, single-page app).  
- **OCR:** [Tesseract.js](https://github.com/naptha/tesseract.js) for client-side text extraction.  
- **AI/LLM:** [Groq API](https://console.groq.com/) for fast large language model inference.  
- **Storage:** LocalStorage for persisting API keys, settings, projects, and custom actions.

## AI Terms (for beginners)

- **OCR (Optical Character Recognition):** Extracts text from images.  
- **LLM (Large Language Model):** AI that understands and generates text.  
- **Prompt:** Instructions given to the AI.  
- **Temperature:** Controls randomness (lower = focused, higher = creative).  
- **Tokens:** Word-pieces used by LLMs (limit controls response length).  
- **Workflow:** Sequence of prompts where each step builds on the previous one.

## üìñ How to Use

1. Open the app in a browser.  
2. Go to ‚öôÔ∏è Settings:  
   - Enter your **Groq API key**.  
   - Load available models.  
   - Adjust temperature and max tokens if needed.  
3. Upload a screenshot (e.g., an error message from a Tizen device).  
4. Click **Extract Text** ‚Üí see raw OCR output.  
5. Click a **CTA button** (or workflow) to get AI explanation.  
6. Copy results to clipboard if needed.

## Example Use Cases

- **Digital signage support teams:**  
  - Extract error codes from screenshots.  
  - Get AI-generated plain-language explanations.  
  - Suggest troubleshooting steps.  

- **Provisioning key handling:**  
  - Detect provisioning keys.  
  - Validate or explain their usage.  

- **Log analysis:**  
  - Extract logs from screenshots.  
  - Summarize or classify them automatically.  

- **Custom prototyping:**  
  - Build small AI-powered tools by chaining workflows.  
  - Example: *Extract ‚Üí Summarize ‚Üí Translate ‚Üí Suggest Action*.

## üîÆ Future Improvements (optional roadmap)

- Cloud storage for projects (sync across devices).  
- Team collaboration (share CTA/workflows).  
- Multi-language OCR (currently only English).  
- Integration with ticketing systems (Jira, ServiceNow).  
- Export workflows as JSON/YAML for sharing.  
- Prebuilt workflow templates for common use cases.  

---

## Why This Is Good

- **Lightweight:** No backend required.  
- **Flexible:** Users can create their own prompts & workflows.  
- **Educational:** Shows how OCR + LLMs + local prototyping can solve real problems.  
- **Scalable:** Can grow into a full AI-powered assistant for support teams.
