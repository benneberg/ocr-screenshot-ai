## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Modular Design

The application follows a clean, modular architecture with six core modules:

```
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ settings.js      ‚Üí API keys, preferences, localStorage
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ocr.js          ‚Üí Tesseract.js integration, image processing
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ llm.js          ‚Üí Groq API communication, AI reasoning
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ workflow.js     ‚Üí Condition evaluation, action execution
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ui.js           ‚Üí DOM manipulation, visual updates
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ main.js         ‚Üí Application bootstrap, event handlers
```

### Data Flow

```
Image Upload ‚Üí OCR Extraction ‚Üí Text Analysis ‚Üí Workflow Execution ‚Üí Results Display
                                        ‚Üì
                                  Groq API (AI Reasoning)
```

## üîê Security & Privacy

- **No Backend:** All processing happens in your browser
- **Local Storage Only:** API keys stored locally, never transmitted
- **No Data Collection:** Zero telemetry or tracking
- **API Communication:** Only with Groq API (user-configured)
- **Client-Side OCR:** Images never leave your device

---

## üöß Troubleshooting

### OCR Not Working
- Ensure image has clear, readable text
- Try images with higher resolution
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify Tesseract.js loaded correctly

### AI Analysis Fails
- Verify API key is saved in Settings
- Click "Test Connection" to check API status
- Ensure you have API credits/quota
- Check browser console for error messages

### Workflows Not Executing
- Confirm workflow is enabled (not paused)
- Verify condition matches extracted text
- Check workflow execution log for errors
- Ensure API key is configured

### Performance Issues
- Large images may take longer to process
- Reduce max tokens if responses are slow
- Consider using faster AI models
- Clear browser cache if sluggish
